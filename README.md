# UEBF
Unified Extensible Binary Format - created just for fun attempt to unify format detection algorythm and prevent kernel code modifying in purpose to enable support of any format. you can easily modify bootloader, here are couple of examples: for bash-like mini-language and for ELF, here are the same format outside, but different inside. Use it as you want ;)
